**Iris Flower Classification Project**

Project Overview:  
This project demonstrates the classification of iris flower species using machine learning.
The Iris dataset contains measurements of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width for three different species of iris flowers: Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor, and Iris-virginica. 
The goal is to build a machine learning model that can classify the species based on these measurements.

Key Steps:  
Data Preparation: The dataset is first cleaned by removing irrelevant columns, and the species labels are encoded into numerical values.  
Train-Test Split: The data is split into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.  
Model Training: A Random Forest Classifier is used to train on the training data.  
Evaluation: The model's accuracy is assessed using the testing data, and a detailed classification report is generated to evaluate precision, recall, and F1-score.

Outcome:
The model has achieved 100% accuracy on the test data, successfully classifying all iris species based on the provided features.
